## 📚 About The Project

`get_next_line` is a 42 School project that implements a function to read a line from a file descriptor, demonstrating advanced C programming concepts like **static variables** and **buffer management**. This project provides a deeper understanding of file I/O operations and memory management in constrained environments.

Key features:
- Reads any file descriptor (files, stdin, pipes, etc.)
- Handles variable buffer sizes (configurable at compile-time)
- Efficient memory usage with single read() call per iteration
- Bonus: Supports multiple file descriptors simultaneously

## 🏁 Getting Started
